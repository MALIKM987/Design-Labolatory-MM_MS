  The goal of this project is to reprogram the TH05_v1.2 chip. This will allow the user to access the device settings and data received via Bluetooth.
# Connecting
  The TH05 chip should be connected to the USB-UART converter as follows:
  
  Adapter      Device <br>
  GND     ->   -Vbat<br>
  +3.3V   ->   +Vbat<br>
  TX      ->    RX1<br>
  RX      ->    TX1<br>
  RTS     ->    RESET<br>
