  The goal of this project is to reprogram the TH05_v1.2 chip. This will allow the user to access the device settings and data received via Bluetooth.
# Connecting
  The TH05 chip should be connected to the USB-UART converter as follows:
  Adapter      Device
  GND     ->   -Vbat
  +3.3V   ->   +Vbat
  TX      ->    RX1
  RX      ->    TX1
  RTS     ->    RESET
